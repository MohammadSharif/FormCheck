## Inspiration
So many people choose to begin lifting weights as a way to lose
weight and put on some muscle; however, many people are inexperienced
and can injure themselves by lifting with improper form. Injuries caused
by lifting weights can be slight or cause big problems through continuous
use of improper form. As a powerlifter I tend to have my friends in the gym
critique my form, or I will record my lift and look back and analyze my form.
For novice lifters this may be difficult as they may not know anyone in the gym
or know what proper form looks like. This is where Form Check comes into play.

## What it does
Form Check allows for users to upload a video of them executing a certain weightlifting
 exercise, which is limited to 10 seconds, and they can then have the general user
 community critique their form. The users that critique another user's form or lift can rate
 it from 1 - 5 stars and also leave feedback to let them know what they can improve.

## How we built it
Form Check was built with a strong dependency on Firebase for user authentication as well as
data storage. Users can log in via Facebook, Google, or use their Email address and it will all
be authenticated through Firebase. Once the user is created their data which consists of their posts,
comments, etc. all get stored in the Firebase database.

## Challenges we ran into
This hack was definitely not a simple one to implement as there were a lot of knew techniques
the entire team worked with. None of us had ever used Firebase so in depth so it was a bit of a
learning curve on the data storage side. Once that was understood it was a matter of understanding
how to properly populate our application with data from the database. A key error point here was pulling
videos from the database and playing them via the android device's built in media player.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Getting so much of this hack completed in the time frame we were given is a big accomplishment to
us already, at a lot of hackathons it's difficult to find products that have been fully completed or
almost near completion. So the fact that we got a majority of the application built is awesome! The
 other accomplishment is that we took a challenging idea that used a technology we weren't fully familiar
 with and we were able to learn how to use that technology and build our idea.

## What we learned
With proper planning and a clear understanding of what we wanted the final product to look like in the
end we were able to finish on time. Time management is a big skill necessary in almost all of life, and
a hackathon time crunch really helps to show you how to appreciate and use the time you have wisely.
